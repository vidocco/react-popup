# react-base-popup

A simple and fully customizable modal/pop-up for React.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save react-base-popup
```

## Importing

```js
import PopUp from 'react-base-popup';
```

## Usage

react-base-popup will display in the page as a button that, on click, will open up a modal display over the entire page. All of the components are fully customizable, there are callback functions available for when the modal appears (OnPop) and when it disappears (OnUnpop) and all props for react-base-popup are validated through PropTypes.

```js
import React from 'react';
import PopUp from 'react-base-popup';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    /**
     * Pass any content that you want displayed on the modal within the two PopUp tags.
     * This content will only be displayed when the button is clicked.
     */
    <PopUp>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
    </PopUp>

    /**
     * You can use the onPop and onUnpop props to pass functions that you want to be
     * executed when the modal appears or disappears (respectively).
     */
    <PopUp
      onPop={() => console.log('Hello!')}
      onUnpop={() => console.log('Goodbye!')}>
    </PopUp>
    
    /**
     * All three components of react-base-popup are fully customizable with the standard
     * react styles. Read more about the available styles and names here: 
     * https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style
     */
    <PopUp
      overlay={{backgroundColor: 'green'}}
      popup={{border-radius: '50px'}}
      button={{width: '1000px', height: '1000px'}}>
    </PopUp>

    /**
     * If any of the props passed to react-base-popup are invalid, there will be a warning
     * in the console displaying the correct type expected for that specific prop.
     */
	<PopUp overlay={() => console.log('hello!')}> //will display a warning
    </PopUp>
  }
}
```
